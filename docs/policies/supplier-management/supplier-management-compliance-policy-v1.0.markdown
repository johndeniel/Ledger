## 1. Purpose

This *Supplier Compliance Policy* establishes the standards and procedures for ensuring that suppliers and their products meet regulatory, ethical, and organizational requirements within the Supplier Management System. It aligns with the *Software Requirements Specification* (SMS-SRS-001) and supports compliance with *GDPR*, *CCPA*, *NIST 800-53*, *ISO 9001:2015*, and the *Buy American Act*.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:
- All suppliers registered in the Supplier Management System via `POST /api/v1/suppliers`.
- Supplier data, including names, addresses, tax IDs, certifications, diversity status, products, and contacts.
- Internal stakeholders (e.g., Procurement Manager, Compliance Officer) accessing supplier data.
- Integrations with enterprise systems (e.g., SAP S/4HANA, Oracle NetSuite) and external APIs (e.g., Dun & Bradstreet).

---

## 3. Regulatory Standards

Suppliers must comply with the following standards, as enforced by the Supplier Management System:

| **Standard**             | **Requirement**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GDPR**                 | Protect personal data (e.g., supplier contacts) with consent and anonymization. |
| **CCPA**                 | Ensure supplier data privacy for California-based entities.                     |
| **NIST 800-53**          | Implement security controls for data integrity and confidentiality.            |
| **ISO 9001:2015**        | Validate supplier quality management certifications.                            |
| **Buy American Act**      | Prioritize U.S.-made products in supplier selection and RFQ processing.        |

- Suppliers must provide valid certifications (e.g., *ISO 9001*, *ISO 14001*) via `POST /api/v1/suppliers/{id}/compliance`.
- Financial stability is verified weekly using *Dun & Bradstreet APIs*.
- Products must include sustainability metrics (e.g., carbon footprint) stored in the `sustainability_metrics` table.

---

## 4. Data Protection

- **Encryption**:
  - Encrypt sensitive supplier data (e.g., tax IDs, contact emails, addresses) using *AES-256* at rest and *TLS 1.3* in transit.
- **Access Control**:
  - Implement *OAuth 2.0* with *Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)* for roles (procurement, admin, analyst).
  - Enforce *Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)* via Auth0 for all users.
- **Security Practices**:
  - Mitigate *OWASP Top 10* risks (e.g., input validation, CSRF prevention).
  - Restrict API usage to *100 requests per minute per user* using *Redis*.

*Example*: A supplier’s address and tax ID are encrypted in the `suppliers` table and accessible only to authorized procurement staff.

---

## 5. Supplier Validation

- **Certification Validation**:
  - Validate supplier certifications (e.g., *ISO 9001*, *ISO 14001*) via `POST /api/v1/suppliers/{id}/compliance`.
  - Require submission of certification documents (up to *10 MB*) stored in *AWS S3* with *AES-256* encryption.
- **Financial Stability**:
  - Verify supplier financial status weekly using *Dun & Bradstreet APIs* via scheduled jobs.
- **Diversity Status**:
  - Prioritize diverse suppliers (e.g., minority-owned) in search results, as stored in the `suppliers.diversity_status` field.
- **Product Compliance**:
  - Ensure products meet *Buy American Act* requirements and track sustainability metrics in the `sustainability_metrics` table.

*Example*: A Procurement Manager submits a supplier’s *ISO 14001* certificate, validated and stored securely in *AWS S3*.

---

## 6. Audit and Reporting

- **Audit Logging**:
  - Log all compliance-related actions (e.g., certification validation, API requests) in the `audit_logs` table with:
    - User ID
    - Action
    - Endpoint
    - Timestamp
- **Compliance Reports**:
  - Generate reports via `GET /api/v1/compliance/reports` in *JSON* format, exportable as *PDF* or *CSV*.
  - Include supplier certification status, financial stability, and sustainability metrics.
- **Audit Support**:
  - Export logs and reports to *Confluence* or *ServiceNow* for quarterly audits.
  - Support audit reviews by the Compliance Officer.

*Example*: A Compliance Officer generates a report showing 95% of suppliers meet *ISO 9001* standards, exported to *Confluence* for audit.

---

## 7. Non-Compliance

- **Detection**:
  - Flag non-compliant suppliers or products (e.g., invalid certifications, non-U.S. products) via `POST /api/v1/suppliers/{id}/compliance`.
  - Log issues in the `audit_logs` table.
- **Actions**:
  - Notify procurement staff via *AWS SES* emails for non-compliance issues.
  - Restrict non-compliant suppliers from RFQ processing until resolved.
  - Escalate persistent issues to the Compliance Officer for review.

*Example*: A supplier’s expired *ISO 14001* certification triggers an email alert and temporary RFQ exclusion.
